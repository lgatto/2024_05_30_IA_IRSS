On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?

Emily M. Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, Shmargaret Shmitchell

> The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the
> development and deployment of ever larger language models,
> especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others,
> most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible
> both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using
> these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for
> specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a
> wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific
> benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask:
> How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this
> technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks?
> We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and
> financial costs first, investing resources into curating and
> carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on
> the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the
> planned approach fits into research and development goals and
> supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions
> beyond ever larger language models.

* When can I use ChatGPT?

Given that
- LLMs have no notion of true or false, nor any understanding of what
  it is asked.
- Probabilistic, based on *biased training data*.

Use it if/when
- You don't can about the validity of the results.
- You are an expert in the field.

* At what cost?

- Human cost.
- Environmental cost.
- Intellectual property.

* AI contamination

* ChatGPT in research

- Reproducibility?
- Paper writing and reviews!

* ChatGPT in education?

Use it if/when
- You don't can about the validity of the results.
- You are an expert in the field.

* Who benefits from ChatGTP?

- In search engines
- Facial recognition
- Microsoft Windows Recall
- Automatic (meaningless) text generation, that is likely being
  re-used for training.

AI can be kind of useful, but I'm not sure that a "kind of useful"
tool justifies the harm.
