## Who am I?

???

I feel it is important to say a few words to put my talk into
perspective:

- I am a [Computational Biologist](https://lgatto.github.io/about/),
  heading the [CBIO lab](https://lgatto.github.io/cbio-lab/) at the
  [de Duve
  Institute](https://www.deduveinstitute.be/research-group/laurent-gatto),
  [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/). We use/develop of DL in the CBIO
  lab. I am not an expert in IA.
- I have never used ChatGPT or any similar tools, and I'll tell you
  why! I however actively follow discussions on IA and its impact on
  society.
- I will focus on ChatGTP and similar LMs that are released by large
  and very powerful commercial entities for wide public consumption. I
  am not focusing on their application in research.

**[On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too
Big?](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922)**, M. Bender,
Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, Shmargaret Shmitchell. March
2021 *Proceedings 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and
Transparency*.

???

If there's one reference to remember, it is this seminal paper

- Emily Bender is a professor of computational linguistics at
  Washington University. Angelina McMillan-Major is/was a PhD student
  in her lab.
- Timnit Gebru is one of the most well-known and respected Black
  female scientists working in AI. She was a co-lead of Google's
  ethical AI research team. In December 2020, her employment with
  Google ended after Google management asked her to either withdraw
  the paper before publication, or remove the names of all the Google
  employees from the paper.
- Margaret Mitchell was later also fired from Google.

## When can I use ChatGPT?

---
class: middle

Following [Yves
Deville](https://webperso.info.ucl.ac.be/~yde/bio.html) and [Christine
Jacqmot](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uwMMh-YAAAAJ)'s
recommendations here.

Given that

> LLMs have absolutely no notion of "true" or "false", nor any
> understanding of what it is asked.

Use it if

> 1. You don't can about the validity of the results.
> 2. You are an expert in the field.

???

Note: lots has been said about ChatGPT's "occasional" hallucinations
(beware of the **anthropomorphising** word here). They always
hallucinate. It just happens so that sometimes, what is made up, is
not wrong. I will come back to some of these points in the later
**stochastic parrot** section.

Assuming you still want to use it, what are the **costs**?

## At what cost?

???

Many have tested ChatGPT. Some ([New AI tools much hyped but not much
used, study says)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511x4g7x7jo)
possibly make regular use of the free and/or the paid version. It
might be used for important or minor/mundane tasks. But at what costs?

## Human cost

- [TIME](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/): OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour.
- [The
  Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/02/ai-chatbot-training-human-toll-content-moderator-meta-openai):
  ‘It’s destroyed me completely’: Kenyan moderators decry toll of
  training of AI models.
- [Business
  Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-kenyan-contract-workers-label-toxic-content-chatgpt-training-report-2023-1):
  Kenyan Workers Paid $2/hr Labeled Horrific Content for OpenAI.
- [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2024/05/03/google-search-raters-wages-benefits-contractors-tech-ai-employment/):
  I’m paid $14 an hour to rate AI-generated Google search
  results. Subcontractors like me do key work but don’t get fair wages
  or benefits.

**Already marginalised communities will suffer the highest human cost.**

???

- Human cost is real and current. It is not a potential
  science-fiction picture of AI vs humanity. Such a picture diminishes
  the current human cost of AI, as is force-fed by big tech.


- Note that this isn't specific to ChatGPT. Similar workers
  exploitation has been documented for Meta/Facebook reviewers from
  the Global South.

## Intellectual property

Where does all that training data come from?

  those that produced that data used for training.

## Stochastic parrot

???

I'll borrow here directly from the paper, to highlight specific issues
with the vast amounts of data needed to train these large models, and
the (absence of) meaning output by the models.

---
class: middle, center, inverse

##  Unfathomable training data

???
- Size doesn't guarantee diversity: from initial participation, to
  data filtering, the data reflect the hegemonic viewpoint.
- Data is static data, but social views change.
- Biais is encoding and amplified in the training data, in particular
  stereotypical associations and negative sentiment towards specific
  groups.
- Large data and the lack of curation, documentation and
  accountability lead to a major documentation debt, that can't be
  addressed after the fact.

**Systematic biais against already marginalised communities.**

## Coherence is in the eye of the beholder

- There is no meaning, no model of the world, no intend to communicate
  in ChatGPT's output.
- Perceived "fluency" and "confidence" give the illusion of (implicit)
  meaning and expertise.
- We tend to mistake the seamingful coherence of LLM outputs for
  meaningful text or expertise.

???

> Contrary to how it may seem when we observe its output, an LM is a
> system for haphazardly stitching together sequences of linguistic
> forms it has observed in its vast training data, according to
> probabilistic information about how they combine, but without any
> reference to meaning: a stochastic parrot.

It is important to note that, in addition to highlight the risks, the
authors do propose paths forward for LM research and development.

## AI contamination

AI-generated text is already ubiquitous on-line, and it becomes more
and more difficult to identify AI-generated text. How long until
AI-generated (meaningless) text (including as answers in Q&A sites),
will be (or are) re-used for training.

Outlets are terminating journalist contract to replace them by AI, and
independent writers are 'competing' against AI.

**Already marginalised communities likely to benefit the
least. Privileged communities to benefit the most.**

???

- In search engines.  Not the users.
- Use your social media photos, posts, info, ... to train AI. Not the
  users.
- Facial recognition. Not the citizens.
- Microsoft Windows Recall. Not the employees.
